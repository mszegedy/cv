Research Assistant Spring 2017–Feb 2020
Rutgers University, Department of Quantitative Biomedicine, Piscataway, NJ
• Research assistant to Professor Sagar Khare.
• Used PyRosetta to investigate thermostability of certain designed proteins.
• Wrote API to allow use of molecular dynamics within Rosetta; presented it at Rosetta-Con 2018 and 2019

Rosetta is a computational protein modeling suite, including libraries, executables, and desktop applications. I had been enthusiastic about Rosetta for several years before taking this position. During my studies, I learned about the AMBER molecular dynamics suite developed at Rutgers. Although previous attempts had been made at creating intercompatability tools for the two suites, none had succeeded. I saw this as a valuable idea, so I applied for this position to attempt to develop my own tool, named AMBRose. Over the course of three years, I developed and maintained this tool. It was widely liked by the Rosetta community, and is now a standard part of the Rosetta Commons suite.
