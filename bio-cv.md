title="Research Assistant"
location="Rutgers University, Department of Quantitative Biomedicine, Piscataway, NJ"
time="2017–2020" %}
- Research assistant to Professor Sagar Khare.
- Used PyRosetta to investigate thermostability of certain designed proteins.
- Wrote API to allow use of molecular dynamics within Rosetta; presented it at
  RosettaCon 2018 and 2019.

<div class="aside">Rosetta is a computational protein modeling suite, including
libraries, executables, and desktop applications. I had been enthusiastic about
Rosetta for several years before taking this position. During my studies, I
learned about the AMBER molecular dynamics suite developed at Rutgers. Although
previous attempts had been made at creating intercompatability tools for the two
suites, none had succeeded. I saw this as a valuable idea, so I applied for this
position to attempt to develop my own tool, named AMBRose. Over the course of
three years, I developed and maintained this tool. It was widely liked by the
Rosetta community, and is now a standard part of the Rosetta suite.</div>

- Learned basics of molecular biology benchwork.
- Sequenced novel gene in duckweed.

# Relevant coursework
**Cytomechanics:** Biomolecular physics from a cytomechanics perspective.
  Received B+.  
**Physics of Living Matter:** Biomolecular physics from a quantum mechanics and
  thermodynamics perspective. Received B.

<div class="aside">The above graduate-level courses were my last two at Rutgers.
I finished both courses with one term paper exploring the viability of achieving
nuclear reactions with biomolecular methods. I'm proud of this, since the first
course applied to my biomedical engineering major, and the second course applied
to my physics major; it felt good to bring the two together in one paper. It is
available <a href="assets/pdfs/term-paper.pdf" target="_blank">here.</a></div>
