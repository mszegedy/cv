# Experience
{% include job_entry.html
title="Research Assistant"
location="Rutgers University, Department of Quantitative Biomedicine, Piscataway, NJ"
time="2017–2020" %}
- Research assistant to Professor Sagar Khare.
- Used PyRosetta to investigate thermostability of certain designed proteins.
- Wrote API to allow use of molecular dynamics within Rosetta; presented it at
  RosettaCon 2018 and 2019.

<div class="aside">Rosetta is a computational protein modeling suite, including
libraries, executables, and desktop applications. I had been enthusiastic about
Rosetta for several years before taking this position. During my studies, I
learned about the AMBER molecular dynamics suite developed at Rutgers. Although
previous attempts had been made at creating intercompatability tools for the two
suites, none had succeeded. I saw this as a valuable idea, so I applied for this
position to attempt to develop my own tool, named AMBRose. Over the course of
three years, I developed and maintained this tool. It was widely liked by the
Rosetta community, and is now a standard part of the Rosetta suite.</div>

<div class="aside">This section is always hard to write concisely. I have
complex feelings about almost every entry here. I have been typesetting most of
my written works in LaTeX since I was 12, and at this point, I have written
several domain-specific markup languages that compile to it. Python is my first
and best scripting language. My first compiled language was C, but now for
performance-critical tasks I prefer Rust, for its modern amenities and memory
safety. I have nothing but bad memories of MATLAB and Matplotlib, but I also
have a hideously deep working knowledge of their internals, and it has been a
long time since anyone's presented me with a bug that I couldn't immediately
fix. Conversely, everyone <i>else</i> seems to hate Regex, but it makes me very
happy to write, maintain, and comment it, no matter how complex. Common Lisp is
my favorite language, but I'd never recommend it for any modern task. And so on.
Every entry is a story. You understand.</div>

# Notable projects
